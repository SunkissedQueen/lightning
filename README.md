The uncertainty of handling error messages and not having clarity of how to even start can be crushing to the aspirations of a novice coder. The thoughts can often overshadow the excitement of wanting to learn code and prevent creativity. Fortunately, there are supportive, inclusive resources in this community called meetup groups, mentors, bootcamps, webinars, and open-source libraries. I will show you how I re-connected to my excitement with coding through p5.js.") 

routes
  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  root "bootstrap_views#index"

  # get "/bootstrap_views", to: "bootstrap_views#index"
  # get "/bootstrap_views/:id", to: "bootstrap_views#show"
  # Rails provides a routes method named resources that creates seven different routes in your application, all mapping to the controller:
  resources :bootstrap_views


controller
  def index
    @topics = Topic.all
  end

    def show
    @topic = Topic.find(params[:id])
  end  

view

- Using the resources we can use the helper path for index
<a href="/bootstrap_views/<%= topic.id %>">  

replace with this line
<a href="<%= bootstrap_view_path(topic) %>">

-Use link_to replace href
<a href="<%= bootstrap_view_path(topic) %>">
  <%= topic.title %>
</a>  

replace with this line
<%= link_to topic.title, bootstrap_view_path(topic) %>

index
<h1>Hello, SD Ruby!!!!</h1>

<h2>The Syntactical Astronaut has been talking to the community.</h2>

<ul>
  <% @topics.each do |topic| %>

    <%= link_to topic.title, bootstrap_view_path(topic) %>

  <% end %>

Start by downloading the image file using the link above and save it to the projectâ€™s app/assets/images folder. All files in the assets directory get compiled by the server and require Rails helper methods to reference the correct file.

Add the image to the page using the image_tag helper method by adding the following code to the top of the welcome.html.erb file:

 <%= image_tag "quiz-bubble.png", height: 300 %>
